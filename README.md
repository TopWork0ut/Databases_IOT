## Lab 1

Task
1. Create a database (DB).
2. In this database, create a scheme with a name that corresponds to the student's last name. All newly created
objects must belong to this schema.
3. Build all necessary objects (tables, primary keys, secondary keys, external keys,
indexes, check constraints) for the specified database.
4. Enter at least 10 abstract records in each database table (if the number of course
not limited to logic).
5. Create a diagram for a fully designed database. Tables should be displayed on
chart in standard mode (columnname, datatype, allow null) Relationships between
adjust the tables in such a way as to indicate between which columns they are
establish a connection.
Designation: P.K. – primary key; U.I. – unique index;
I. – non-unique index; CHECK is a check constraint.

## Variant 45 :

Create a relational database schema that allows you to store data
about the schedule of meals and the use of nutritional supplements for
an athlete Anticipate that the schedule may consist of certain
days, or for a certain duration (for example - 3 times a day, during
two months). The system must contain information about supplements,
the available dishes and their components, the energy value of each dish,
about the athlete (type of sport, height, weight, information about the competition, etc
which the athlete has taken and will participate in) and about the coach/doctor,
who prepares a meal schedule for him
