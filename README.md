## Lab 5

Task:

For the designed database, implement a Back-end project using the Spring Boot ecosystem (Spring Data JPA) in the form of a Maven project with a connection to MySQL.

Controllers should process requests for CRUD operations and return the necessary data in the form of DTO objects with links (web addresses), according to HATEOAS recommendations.

Services must contain basic business logic for working with data.

If necessary, repositories can contain additional methods (automatically generated or with JPQL queries) for working with data.

Implement client work with data through Swagger:

 - data output from tables;
 
 - inserting data into the table;
 
 - updating data in tables.
 
 - deleting data from the table;
 
 - data output from the side of the M:1 connection, that is, for example, for each city, output the people who live in it;
 
 - data output from the connection table of the M:M connection, that is, to output for each subject from one table all the subjects of the second table that are connected to it.
 
The implemented project should be uploaded to GitHub.
